Find museums in different cities and countries and see which one you have not visited yet or plan your future visits. You can click on the markers and see the useful info about every museum. You can also get useful Wikipedia links about the chosen city.

In my project I have chosen Google Map Api and Wikipedia Api. It's one page app that uses knockout.js binding, jQuery, node Js and Express Js.

To build this project I used several sources:

1. http://knockoutjs.com/
2. BikeinCity project, http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/387626/BikeInCity-2-KnockoutJS-JQuery-Google-Maps
3. Various examples on internet.

You can see the demo here: http://museum.oxanaweb.com/
